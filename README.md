# Introduction
The DLT Adapter, also referred to as the DLT Interface is a component used by the Blockchain Connector to interact with the Blockchain technology in a transparent way. It is provided as a REST API.

It is built using TypeScript 4.7.4 with express 4.17.3. **Keep in mind that this is a WIP and it is not production-ready yet**.

## Main features:
